# mobile_mitm
## This is an experiment on how to intercept mobile data on a network using a proxy server .

## This report shows how to check data usage by mobile applications / mobile ooerating system and predicts how privacy can be voilated . This is small experiment you can extend it on large scale and for more protocols like xmpp etc .

### Steps :
1. I have chosen Burp suite as my intercepter and as proxy .
2. Here i have generated a self signed ssl certificate and then installed it in user's mobile .
3. The same certificate was also installed in Burp suite so that it can decrypt all the ssl traffic .

## Note :- we can also use squid proxy server in transparent mode to intercept user data.

## Full blown steps of mitm and report on mobile privacy is present [here]().
