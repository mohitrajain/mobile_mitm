# mobile_mitm
## This is an experiment on how to intercept mobile data on a network using a proxy server .

## This report shows how to check data usage by mobile applications / mobile operating system and predicts how privacy can be voilated . This is small experiment you can extend it on large scale and for more protocols like xmpp etc .

### Basic insights :
### 1. The tested mobile is configured to use our proxy server . 
### 2. I used iptables to create accept proxy connections . ( iptables is also used for transparent proxy )
### 3. I have chosen Burp suite as my intercepter/proxy . ( only Http and https traffic is monitored this way )
### 4. I also generated a self signed ssl certificate using openssl and then installed it in user's mobile .
### 5. The same certificate was also installed in Burp suite so that it can decrypt all the ssl traffic .

## Note :- we can also use squid proxy server in transparent mode to intercept mobile data.
